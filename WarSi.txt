I Introduction

Software Center is software to manage application in a operating sistem such as install, delete or upgrade applications. It is a required software in all operating system, both conventional or mobile devices. BlankOn as the Indonesian local operating system should have this application but in reality this application is not yet available [1].

Traditionaly, to do package managemen, user deal with installaing package form console with apt syntac. This way is worst to other people. In other way user can use Synaptic Package Manager, a simple software center. But this interface just to old style.

HTML5 is a trend of programming because this technology easy to adapted, can run in multple platfrom up to desktop utilization [2].

This research tries to make software center HMTL5-based as solution for BlankOn.

II Tradicional Software center

A. YaST (yet another setup tool)
Software center for opensuse. It use to manage all of user need for use opensuse. Example to install application, package, network setting etc. YaST devel form ruby and YCP and qt for UI, base c++[3 yast vendor].
